                <h4 id="banner">Background</h4>
                <p>Hello! I’m Alejandro, a 21-year old Puerto Rican undergraduate student at the University of Puerto Rico at Bayamon. Currently, I’m on my 4th year of my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science learning about important topics such as Data Structures & Algorithms, Web Programming, Computer Architecture, Commercial Programming, among others concepts that prepare me to be a software engineer. To this day, I continue to participate in clubs and associations that empower me to learn new things using resources that I wouldn’t normally find in a classrooms, such as coding competitions and tech workshops.</p>
                  <p>Right now, I continue to pursue leadership roles on my institution’s Honor Studies Program as President, where I help other students partake on research at our university. I’m also a member of the Association of Computing Machinery and the Computer Science Student Association, which is a great student club since it enables me to network with other people that share my interests and goals. </p>
                  <p>
                    In addition to my courses, I have been able do apply my knowledge and programming skills in hands-on settings in separated programs. I’d say my portfolio introduces me better than my words do, so either in the <a href="#experience-sec">experiences</a> section or in the <a href="cs-portfolio.html">CS portfolio</a> section, you’ll be able to see all my work and where I’ve been able to gain experience while also learning!
                  </p>
                  <h4 id="banner">Most Recent</h4>
                  <p>
                    Although I’m a full-time student, I’m a strong believer that one should always keep learning new things outside of the classroom. I’m taking online bootcamps, using platforms such as Coursera and Udemy, that are focused on learning new programming languages and tools that help me develop my own projects as an aspiring software engineer. As of now, I’m focusing on learning Web Development, which is one of my new passions and the area of speciality that I would like to work on in any new internships or software development jobs that might come around. 
                    <p>
                    <b style="color: rgb(96, 94, 94)">Fun fact:</b> this web site is one of the first projects of my journey of learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript! 
                    </p>
                  </p>
                  <h4 id="banner">Future Plans</h4>
                  <p>Even though I will hopefully be graduating on May 2024, I’m currently focusing on learning new softwares and developing applications to strengthen my technical and analytical skills as a software developer. This will help on my search for internships and software jobs. It will also prepare me for my Capstone project of my last year of university before graduation.
                  </p>
                  <p>As a primary goal, I aspire to acquire a Web Development or Software Engineering Internship that would help me be more competitive on my field after graduation.
                  </p>
