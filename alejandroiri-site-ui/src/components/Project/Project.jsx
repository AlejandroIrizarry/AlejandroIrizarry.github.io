        <p className="project-desc"><b>LifeTracker</b>  includes a robust authentication system using PostgreSQL and bcrypt, an Express API for user-related activity storage, and multiple models implementing core business logic for life tracking. I wrote SQL queries for user statistics aggregation and summary overviews. The React frontend communicates with the API using an API service class, featuring pages and forms that interact with the server through HTTP requests. The application state is managed on the frontend using useEffect and useState hooks, with user-authenticated JWT tokens stored in the browser's local storage for persistent authentication.<br/><br/><h4>What is the LifeTracker App?</h4>Everywhere around us is data waiting to be collected and utilized. In recent years, we've seen the rise of applications and services that exist to quantify concepts that were previously hard to capture. FitBit, Apple Health, and Woop are all $1 billion dollar services to offer tracking statistics about how we live our lives. The LifeTracker app will do exactly that - track your life by quantifying your activity.</p>

        offers users a seamless movie exploration experience by leveraging The Movie Database API. The grid view, identified by the movies-grid ID, displays current movies as a grid of movie cards with the movie-card class. Each card includes essential details such as the movie title (class: movie-title), poster image (class: movie-poster), and votes (class: movie-votes). Users can effortlessly load more movies by clicking the load-more-movies-btn, dynamically expanding the list without refreshing the page. The search functionality is enhanced with a search input (id: search-input), enabling users to query the API by entering text and triggering a search request upon hitting 'Enter.' The search results are presented in a grid view. Additionally, the close-search-btn (id) allows users to exit the search, clear results, and return to the display of current movies. The website prioritizes basic HTML/CSS accessibility features and ensures responsiveness for a seamless user experience across devices.
